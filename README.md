## Features

- **Dog Breed Identification**: Classify images of dogs into various breeds using a convolutional neural network.
- **Loan Defaulter Classification**: Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan based on their financial information.
- **Heart Disease Patient Classification**: Identify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical data.
- **Bulldozer Sales Prediction Analysis**: Uses ensemble Regression Models to predict the sales of Bulldozers and Analysis of sales over time.
